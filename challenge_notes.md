- Cant easily connect a paypal account to a whatsapp group - in a very basic nutshell that is what the plan is
- May need to implement some chat functionality? But that is secondary, could be done through linking with another application
- Implement a 'credit score' for the members of the dao
- Every claim premium and excess goes up
- Automatic adjustment of premiums based on amount of money in dao
    - Based on number of users, claims per month etc.
- implement voting feature
- We are supposed to focus on the setup, not the actual operation so maybe everything above is mute
    - Wizard is base case
    - If we have time we can start implementing the actual app
    - Voting would be a simple thing we can do
    - Authentication
    - Claim application page
    - Don't worry about payment (including gateway page)
- Not necessary to link with blockchain
- Termination notice period
- Joining premium?
